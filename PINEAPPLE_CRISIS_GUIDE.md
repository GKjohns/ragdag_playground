# 🍍 The Great Pineapple Crisis of Tropicana Island

## Overview

A fully fictional dataset of 15 interconnected documents about mysterious glowing pineapples that appeared on the fictional island nation of Tropicana. This dataset was created specifically to test the RagDAG system's ability to uncover hidden patterns, contradictions, and investigative elements that no LLM would have prior knowledge of.

## The Story

Over 5 days in March 2024, the island nation of Tropicana experienced an unprecedented phenomenon: pineapples that glowed purple, maintained constant temperatures of 42.7°C, and exhibited properties that challenged scientific understanding. The crisis evolved from initial discovery through government cover-up attempts to eventual acceptance that these might be gifts rather than threats.

## Document Collection

The dataset includes:
- **4 Email exchanges** (government officials, scientists, whistleblowers)
- **3 News reports** (local and international coverage)
- **3 Social media posts** (public reactions and observations)
- **2 Scientific reports** (Dr. Flores, Dr. Tanaka/WHO)
- **2 Government memos** (classified and executive orders)
- **1 Emergency cabinet transcript** (partially redacted)

## Hidden Investigative Elements

### 1. Timeline Contradictions
- Minister Santos claims "isolated incident" on Day 1, but military documents reveal 37 affected specimens by Day 2
- Government denies rumors publicly while simultaneously establishing quarantine zones
- Whistleblower reveals pineapples appeared overnight, contradicting official planting records

### 2. Numerical Patterns
- **42.7°C**: Every affected specimen maintains this exact temperature
- **73 Hz**: Humming frequency emitted by specimens
- **0.7 Hz**: Pulsation rate (matches human heart rate)
- **528 Hz**: Frequency they respond to
- **300%**: Growth rate compared to normal
- **400%**: Silicon-30 levels above normal

### 3. Sentiment Evolution
- **Day 1**: Scientific curiosity vs. government concern
- **Day 2**: Public panic vs. official denial
- **Day 3**: Crisis mode, whistleblower revelations
- **Day 4**: International concern, scientific fascination
- **Day 5**: Acceptance, "gift not crisis" narrative

### 4. Cover-up Evidence
- Minister Santos consistently downplays the situation
- Military involvement predates public acknowledgment
- Classified portions of documents redacted
- Shift from secrecy to transparency under pressure

### 5. Multiple Theories
- Fungal infection (official initial claim)
- Extraterrestrial origin (whistleblower)
- Ancient return (indigenous knowledge)
- Scientific anomaly (research team)
- Communication attempt (final hypothesis)

## Quick Investigations

The UI provides six preset investigation goals:

1. **📅 Timeline**: Reconstruct the sequence of events
2. **⚡ Contradictions**: Find inconsistencies between accounts
3. **🕵️ Cover-up**: Identify suppression attempts
4. **📈 Sentiment**: Track emotional evolution
5. **🔢 Patterns**: Analyze numerical anomalies
6. **🔬 Theories**: Compare competing explanations

## How to Use

1. Click the **"🍍 Pineapple Crisis Investigation"** button in the UI
2. This loads all 15 documents as input data
3. Either use the main goal provided or select a quick investigation
4. Click "Generate Plan" to see the DAG
5. Click "Execute Plan" to run the analysis

## Expected Discoveries

A thorough analysis should uncover:
- Government attempted cover-up failed due to social media
- The pineapples exhibit mathematically significant patterns
- Indigenous knowledge proved more accurate than scientific assumptions
- The phenomenon represents potential communication, not threat
- Public sentiment shifted from fear to acceptance over 5 days

## Technical Testing Value

This dataset tests RagDAG's ability to:
- Process multiple document types simultaneously
- Identify contradictions across temporal sequences
- Detect subtle numerical patterns
- Track sentiment evolution
- Correlate information from diverse sources
- Generate insights about completely novel scenarios

## The Mystery Continues...

The documents end with the pineapples producing crystalline seeds that grow normal-looking but extraordinary-tasting pineapples. The investigation remains open - what message were they trying to convey? Why now? And what do the frequency patterns mean?

Perfect for testing investigative AI systems on truly unknown content! 🍍✨
